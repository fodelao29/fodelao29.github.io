    <h3>My Podcast</h3>

        </div>
        <p>I created this podcast for many reasons, but  the main one was because I love sharing not just my experience,but the experience of others, and learn form them.
            Realiades means Realities, and I search for people who know and have lived incredible things that not everyone is capable to talk about.  </p>
        <br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img  src="images/pod_img_2.png">
        </div>
        <p>The people I bring to the podcast know the reality of: Living in a different Country, Succeding in a very difficult environment, and many other things that we tend to think are easy, 
            not important or we just have a complete false idea about.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>Realidades is a small project at the moment, with time people with greater experience will be part of this project, where the intention is always show the reality about the things we don't know,
            we don't want to know, or we are unable to understand. This projects comes form my heart and I hope people around the globe can open their eyes to the true reality.
